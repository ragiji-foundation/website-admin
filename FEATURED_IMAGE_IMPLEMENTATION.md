# Blog Featured Image Upload Implementation

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

### Frontend (Blog Creation Form)
- **MediaUpload Component**: Centralized image upload component is integrated
- **Form State**: `featuredImage` field added to blog state 
- **Preview Functionality**: Featured image displays in the blog preview
- **UI Integration**: Clean upload interface with preview in the main content area

### Backend Preparation
- **Database Schema**: Updated to include `featuredImage` field in Blog model
- **API Route**: Prepared to handle `featuredImage` in create/read operations
- **Migration File**: Ready to apply database changes

## 🔧 Next Steps (When Database is Available)

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Run the migration script
./scripts/migrate-featured-image.sh

# OR manually:
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Enable API Features
After migration, the API route will automatically support:
- Saving `featuredImage` URLs to database
- Returning `featuredImage` data in blog responses
- Featured image display in blog lists and individual posts

## 🚀 Current Functionality

### Image Upload Flow
1. **User clicks "Upload Featured Image"** → MediaUpload component opens
2. **File selection** → Image uploads to MinIO storage  
3. **URL returned** → Stored in blog state and displayed in preview
4. **Form submission** → Image URL included in blog data
5. **Database storage** → Ready when migration is applied

### Components Used
- `MediaUpload`: Handles file upload to MinIO with preview
- `BilingualInput`: For multilingual content support
- `TiptapEditor`: Rich text editor for blog content
- `useApiData` & `useCrudOperations`: Centralized data management

## 🎯 Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Centralized Upload**: Reusable MediaUpload component across the application
2. **MinIO Integration**: Professional file storage with proper organization
3. **Preview Functionality**: Users can see how images will appear
4. **Bilingual Support**: Ready for Hindi/English content

6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management in upload process

## 🧪 Testing (After Migration)

1. Navigate to `/blogs/create`
2. Fill in blog title and content
3. Click "Upload Featured Image"
4. Select an image file
5. Verify preview appears correctly
6. Submit the form
